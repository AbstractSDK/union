# Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have experience creating contracts in CosmWasm. If you need to familiarize yourself with CosmWasm, you should start with the [CosmWasm book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/) and the other [resources listed by the CosmWasm team](https://cosmwasm.com/build).

The Union team uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage developer environments. While this tutorial may mention different developer tools, it will not guide you through setting each one up.

This tutorial will assume that you have a working rust tool chain, including `cargo`.

You will also need a chain that supports CosmWasm running where you plan to deploy ucs03 and your app. This tutorial will assume you're running the Union devnet.

# Tutorial

1. Write your contract
2. Deploy your contract
3. Example transfer

## Write Your Contract

To demonstrate asset transfers with ucs03, this tutorial will walk you through creating a simple contract that sends a single token.

### Project Bootstrapping

If you don't already have a project folder for your contract, make one now and navigate inside.

```sh
cargo new --lib example-ucs03-cosmwasm
cd example-ucs03-cosmwasm
```

Add required dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "example-ucs03-cosmwasm" # name of the project
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", 'rlib']

[dependencies]
cosmwasm-schema = { version = "2.1.4" }
cosmwasm-std = { version = "2.1.4", default-features = false, features = ["std", "staking", "stargate"] }
serde = { version = "1.0.210", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
thiserror = { version = "1.0.64", default-features = false }

[features]
library = []

[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
strip = true  
```

Below is a sample contract that can be pasted into `lib.rs`.

```rust title="src/lib.rs"
use cosmwasm_schema::cw_serde;
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::entry_point;
use cosmwasm_std::{
    to_json_binary, Coin, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, Uint128, Uint256, WasmMsg,
};

use crate::ContractError;

#[cw_serde]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {}

#[derive(serde::Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Transfer {
        channel_id: u32,
        receiver: String,
        base_token: String,
        base_amount: Uint128,
        quote_token: String,
        quote_amount: Uint256,
        contract_address: String,
    },
}

#[derive(serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum Ucs03ExecuteMsg {
    Transfer {
        channel_id: u32,
        receiver: String,
        base_token: String,
        base_amount: Uint128,
        quote_token: String,
        quote_amount: Uint256,
        timeout_height: u64,
        timeout_timestamp: u64,
        salt: [u8; 32],
    },
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    Ok(Response::default())
}

#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Transfer {
            channel_id,
            receiver,
            base_token,
            base_amount,
            quote_token,
            quote_amount,
            contract_address,
        } => transfer(
            deps,
            env,
            channel_id,
            receiver,
            base_token,
            base_amount,
            quote_token,
            quote_amount,
            contract_address,
        ),
    }
}

fn transfer(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    channel_id: u32,
    receiver: String,
    base_token: String,
    base_amount: Uint128,
    quote_token: String,
    quote_amount: Uint256,
    contract_address: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let msg = WasmMsg::Execute {
        contract_addr: contract_address.to_string(),
        msg: to_json_binary(&Ucs03ExecuteMsg::Transfer {
            channel_id,
            receiver: receiver.clone(),
            base_token: base_token.clone(),
            base_amount,
            quote_token,
            quote_amount,
            timeout_height: 0,
            timeout_timestamp: 0,
            salt: [0; 32],
        })
        .expect("can convert into json binary"),
        funds: vec![Coin {
            denom: base_token,
            amount: base_amount,
        }],
    };

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_message(msg)
        .add_attribute("action", "transfer")
        .add_attribute("recipient", receiver)
        .add_attribute("amount", base_amount.to_string()))
}
```

### Building the Contract

With this contract code ready, the WASM blob can be built.

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=mvp -C opt-level=z' cargo build \
    --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
    --no-default-features \
    --lib \
    --release \
    -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
    -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort

mkdir -p build

wasm-opt target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/example_ucs01_cosmwasm.wasm \
    -o build/contract.wasm \
    -O3 --converge
```

The contract can now be deployed.

## Deploying your Contract

With the WASM blob ready, the contract can be deployed.

```sh
uniond tx wasm store ./build/contract.wasm \
    --from $KEY_NAME \
    --gas auto \
    --gas-adjustment 1.4 \
    --chain-id union-devnet-1 \
    --node http://localhost:26657/ \
    --yes

TX_HASH=..
```

Be sure to copy the `CODE_ID` of the newly stored code. Using the previous transaction hash, you can see it by running this command:
```sh
uniond query tx $TX_HASH --node http://localhost:26657 | rg -C 1 "code_id"  
```

Next, submit a transaction to instantiate the contract. Copy the value of the **NEW** transaction hash into a shell variable (`TX_HASH`).

```sh
uniond tx wasm instantiate $CODE_ID "{}" \
  --node http://localhost:26657/ \
  --from $KEY_NAME \
  --label your-contract \
  --no-admin \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.4 \
  --chain-id union-devnet-1

TX_HASH=..
```

You can then get the contract address by running:
```sh
uniond query tx $TX_HASH --node http://localhost:26657 | rg -C 1 "_contract_address"  
```

## Example Transfer

With the address of your contract in hand, a sample transfer can now be conducted.

First, prepare a `payload.json` that will hold the main message of the transfer.

```json title="payload.json"  
{
  "transfer": {
    "channel_id": 1,
    "receiver": "<RECEIVER_ADDRESS>",
    "base_token": "muno",
    "base_amount": 1000000,
    "quote_token": "",
    "quote_amount": 0,
    "contract_address": "<UCS03_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>",
  }
}
```

The message can then be sent to the contract for execution.

```sh
uniond \
    tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "$(jq -c '.' payload.json)" \
        --from $KEY_NAME \
        --gas auto \
        --gas-adjustment 1.4 \
        --chain-id union-devnet-1 \
        --node http://localhost:26657 \
        --amount 2000000muno
```
