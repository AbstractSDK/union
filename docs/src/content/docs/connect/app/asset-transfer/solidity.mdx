# Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have experience creating contracts in Solidity.

The Union team uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) to manage developer environments. While this tutorial may mention different developer tools, it will not guide you through setting each one up.

This tutorial uses [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to create and manage the solidity contract.

This tutorial assumes ucs03-zkgm has been deployed to the EVM you're deploying your contract to.

# Transfer

To demonstrate asset transfers with ucs03, this tutorial will walk you through creating a simple contract that sends USDC to Union.

## Project Bootstrapping

Initialize a new foundry project to house the Solidity contract.

```sh
forge init ucs03-asset-transfer
```

This will create a project with the following folder structure.

<FileTree>
- ucs03-asset-transfer
  - foundry.toml
  - lib
    - forge-std
  - README.md
  - script
    - Counter.s.sol
  - src
    - Counter.sol
  - test
    -Counter.t.sol
</FileTree>

Rename `script/Counter.s.sol` and `src/Counter.sol` to `script/Transfer.s.sol` and `src/Transfer.sol`. Delete the test folder as it won't be used in this example.

### Contract Source

```solidity title="src/Transfer.sol"
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import {IERC20} from "forge-std/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

interface Ucs03 {
  function transfer(
      uint32 channelId,
      bytes calldata receiver,
      address baseToken,
      uint256 baseAmount,
      bytes calldata quoteToken,
      uint256 quoteAmount,
      uint64 timeoutHeight,
      uint64 timeoutTimestamp,
      bytes32 salt
  ) external;
}

contract Transfer {
  address public constant relay = 0xD0081080Ae8493cf7340458Eaf4412030df5FEEb;
  address public constant usdc = 0xa833B03D8ED1228C4791cBfAb22b3ED57954429F;
  address public constant receiver = 0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238;

  function transferAsset() public {
    IERC20(usdc).approve(relay, 1000000);

    Ucs03(relay).transfer(
      90,
      hex"a833B03D8ED1228C4791cBfAb22b3ED57954429F",
      receiver,
      1000000,
      "usdc",
      1000000,
      1000000,
      0,
      bytes32("")
    );
  }
}


```

### Contract Running Script

```solidity title="script/Transfer.s.sol"
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import {Script, console} from "forge-std/Script.sol";
import {Transfer} from "../src/Transfer.sol";
import {IERC20} from "forge-std/interfaces/IERC20.sol";

contract TransferScript is Script {
  address public constant USDC = 0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238;

  function run() public {
    uint256 privateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
    vm.startBroadcast(privateKey);
    Transfer transfer = new Transfer();

    IERC20(USDC).transfer(address(transfer), 1500000);

    console.log("transferring");
    transfer.transferAsset();
    console.log("complete");
    vm.stopBroadcast();
  }
}
```
