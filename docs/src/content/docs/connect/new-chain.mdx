If your chain is not yet [connected to Union](../protocol/chains/overview/), then you can permissionlessly add support. Union supports L1s, L2s, L3s, and Rollups. The steps to connect are simple:

<Steps>
1. Upload Union contracts
2. Configure a relayer
3. Open the connection
4. Send assets and data
</Steps>

## Upload Union contracts

You'll need to upload two contracts:

- [union-ibc](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/tree/main/cosmwasm/union-ibc/core): Union's modular IBC stack.
- [cometbls-light-client](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/tree/main/cosmwasm/union-ibc/light-clients/cometbls): Light-client tracking [CometBLS](/architecture/cometbls) consensus.
