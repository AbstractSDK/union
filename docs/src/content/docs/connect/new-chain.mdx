If your chain is not yet [connected to Union](../protocol/chains/overview/), then you can permissionlessly add support. Union supports L1s, L2s, L3s, and Rollups. The steps to connect are simple:

<Steps>
1. Upload Union contracts
2. Configure a relayer
3. Open the connection
4. Send assets and data
</Steps>

## Upload Union contracts

You'll need to upload two contracts:

- [union-ibc](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/tree/main/cosmwasm/union-ibc/core): Union's modular IBC stack.
- [cometbls-light-client](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/tree/main/cosmwasm/union-ibc/light-clients/cometbls): Light-client tracking [CometBLS](/architecture/cometbls) consensus.


### Cosmos

To upload [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) contracts to your Cosmos chain, you need your chain's binary. We'll use `starsd` in this example. 

```bash
nix build github:unionlabs/union#union-ibc -L
```

```bash
mkdir ./starsd-home
./starsd init --chain-id elgafar-1 --home ./starsd-home cor-systems
./starsd keys add cor-systems --home ./starsd-home
# this will give you your address: stars1qcvavxpxw3t8d9j7mwaeq9wgytkf5vwputv5x4
```


```bash
./starsd tx wasm store ./contracts/union_ibc.wasm --from cor-systems --home ./starsd-home --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.4 --gas-prices 1ustars --node https://rpc.elgafar-1.stargaze.chain.kitchen --chain-id elgafar-1 -y
```

this will give you a tx hash

query your contract's id:
```bash
./starsd query tx C6D45BE9A40F92D82E94C0B4D2AFA48812A9FE28E5761700E496ED29F8D53977 --node https://rpc.elgafar-1.stargaze.chain.kitchen

# => 5011
```
