### Identifier

Each connection has a `connection-id`, uniquely identifying the connection on that specific chain. Note that this identifier
is not globally unique, such that two chains can both have a connection with ID `10`. This does not mean that, since the IDs
are the same, the connections are connected to each other.

### Status

A connection goes through different states referred to as `status`: `INIT`, `TRY`, `ACK`, and `CONFIRM`. Unless you 
are opening connections yourself, you only need to concern yourself with the `CONFIRM` state, which means the connection 
can now be used to open channels.

### Clients

Each connection is verified by a client, which describes the consensus protocol of the counterparty chain. 
Client IDs have 2 potential formats:

- `{algorithm}-{instatiation}`: `07-tendermint-4038` or `08-wasm-66`, where `07-tendermint` and `08-wasm` are the algorithms. 
- `{instatiation}`: `12`, `666`, `420`. This format is found in newer stacks as it is significantly more gas-efficient.

Most consumers of the IBC stack should not care about clients or client ids. They all provide the same (highest possible) security level,
and are abstracted away by our stack.

### Connections Table

This table provides live information on current connections.
