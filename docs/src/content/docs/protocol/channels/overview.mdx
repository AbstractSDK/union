import ChannelsTable from '#/components/svelte/tables/ChannelsTable.svelte'

Channels serve different protocol types, indicated by their `version`. These can be fully custom, although most of the 
time they will be one of the enshrined types (such as [`ucs03-zkgm-1`](/protocol/channels/ucs03-zkgm)).
